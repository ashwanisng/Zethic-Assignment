The shore line of the lake, is about 15.5 kilometres (9.6 mi), is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks, houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir and from houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras. During the winter season, the temperature sometimes reaches −11 °C (12 °F), freezing the lake.

The wetland is divided by causeways into four basins; Gagribal, Lokut Dal, Bod Dal and Nagin (although Nagin is also considered as an independent lake). Lokut-dal and Bod-dal each have an island in the centre, known as Rup Lank (or Char Chinari) and Sona Lank respectively.The houseboats are closely associated with Dal Lake which provide accommodation to tourists in Srinagar.

    Ever wondered what heaven looks like? Come to Pangong Lake and see for yourself. The view of the breathtaking Himalayas encircling the pristine lake that lies beneath the blue azure is nothing less than a miracle. 

Situated at an elevation of 4225 meters in the lap of the Himalayas, this 132 km long lake is brackish or salty in nature and doesn't support any underwater life. Commonly shared by India and China (with 60% part with China), the beauty of this calming lake is admired by people around the world. Especially during the winter season, when the whole landscape lights up with the arrival of migratory birds.

It is the best time for bird watchers to witness exotic bird species which makes this place being considered for a Ramsar Site. Pangong Tso Lake is the first transboundary wetland in South Asia and is believed to be separated from the Indus River basin in prehistoric times. Another astonishing fact about this tranquil lake is that despite being brackish in nature, it freezes into a thick ice sheet during the winters

    "name": "Lake Superior",
    "description": '''
    Lake Superior is one of the five North American Great Lakes and is considered the largest among all freshwater lakes globally. Based on its surface area, it surpasses all other freshwater lakes in the world (which excludes the largest lake, the Caspian Sea, as it is a saline lake). Lake Superior holds many titles and has many records, including holding 10% of all the world’s surface freshwater. Yes, that’s how big it is! But apart from all these titles and records, Lake Superior has more things to offer, such as a diverse freshwater ecosystem and an amazingly clear underwater visibility! Despite the lake’s enormous surface area, it still doesn’t rank at the world’s top 10 deepest lakes. But that doesn’t mean it is not deep. So, how deep do you think Lake Superior is? This article will answer that and more!
The name Lake Superior gives justice to this vast body of water. It refers to the lake’s size and its position far North, which makes it the northernmost lake of all the North American Great Lakes. But apart from its wide surface area, Lake Superior also boasts a wowing depth of 1,332 feet or 406 meters. Given its expansive surface area that extends 160 miles (257 kilometers) wide and 350 miles (563 kilometers) long, it sure contains a massive volume of water. The lake’s overall surface area is 31,700 square miles holding a water volume of 2,900 cubic miles. Lake Superior has so much water that it surpasses even all the water of the other Great Lakes combined, plus three more Lake Erie’s! The lake is so enormous and has such a large volume that emptying it at its current rate (without offsetting water additions) would take 191 years.
